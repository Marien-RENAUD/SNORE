# Stochastic generalization of Plug-and-Play

Based on the code from the paper "Gradient Step Denoiser for convergent Plug-and-Play" published at ICLR 2022. [[github](https://github.com/samuro95/GSPnP)]

This code is made to test the method Average PnP and other kind of methods (PnP-SGD, PnP-GD...) to explore the utility of stochastic version of PnP to solve inverse problem in imaging.
